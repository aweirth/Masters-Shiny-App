# Masters Shiny App Dashboard

This repository contains my final project done for my graduate data visualization class at Willamette University. The goal of this project was to create a better tool for avid golf fans to access and understand important tournament data through an interactive data dashboard synthesizing PGA Tour Tournament statistics. This project was completed using an R Shiny App which can be viewed at this [link](https://aweirth.shinyapps.io/shiny_masters/).
